The solution is to add the correct dependency to the dependency array. In this case, we're using `count` from the state, so we add that to the dependency array.  If `count` changes, the effect will run again; otherwise, it will only run once after the initial render.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Effect running');
    // Do something that causes a re-render
    // Removed re-render to avoid the error    setCount(count + 1);
  }, [count]); // Added count to the dependency array

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
